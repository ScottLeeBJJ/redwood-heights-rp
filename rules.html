        <div class="rule">
            <div class="rule-title">
                1. Respect All Players <span class="arrow">▶</span>
            </div>
            <div class="rule-content">
                <h3>1. Respect is a priority.</h3>
                <p>*Players must treat everyone fairly, regardless of gender, race, or nationality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redwood Heights is a roleplaying community where respect is a priority. Players must treat everyone fairly, regardless of gender, race, or nationality.</li>
                    <li>No harassment: Avoid bullying, repeated unwanted interactions, or verbal attacks.</li>
                    <li>No hate speech: Discriminatory language based on race, gender, or identity is not tolerated.</li>
                    <li>No toxic behavior: Deliberate aggravation or provocation outside roleplay is unacceptable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Roleplay at All Times (In-Character Behavior)</h3>
                <p>*Players must stay in character at all times to maintain immersion.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>OOC Chats: Use out-of-character chat sparingly and mark it with (( )) or use designated OOC channels.</li>
                    <li>Immersion: Avoid references to real-world events or breaking character in-game unless absolutely necessary.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. No Random Deathmatch (RDM)</h3>
                <p>*Attacking or killing another player without an in-character reason is prohibited.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conflict escalation: Ensure proper buildup before any violent actions, such as arguments or ongoing tensions.</li>
                    <li>Revenge killing: Do not kill someone for revenge without a justified in-character reason.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. No Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)</h3>
                <p>*Running over or using vehicles to kill players without roleplay justification is not allowed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accidental VDM: If you accidentally hit another player, roleplay the situation realistically (e.g., call emergency services).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. No Metagaming!</h3>
                <p>*Do not use out-of-character information to influence in-game decisions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knowledge separation: Keep in-game knowledge and out-of-character information separate.</li>
                    <li>OOC voice chats: Don’t use OOC voice chats to relay in-game information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. No Powergaming</h3>
                <p>*Powergaming involves forcing actions onto other players without allowing them to respond.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give others a chance: Allow players to respond to your actions instead of forcing outcomes (e.g., instead of “I knock you out,” say “I attempt to knock you out, what do you do?”).</li>
                    <li>Avoid unrealistic actions: Don’t perform actions that your character wouldn’t be able to do based on their abilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. No Exploiting or Hacking</h3>
                <p>*Using bugs, glitches, or third-party software to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Report bugs: If you discover an exploit or bug, report it to the staff immediately.</li>
                    <li>No external mods: Hacking or using unauthorized modifications will result in an immediate ban.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Respect Law Enforcement & EMS</h3>
                <p>*Law enforcement and EMS play important roles in the server, and their authority must be respected.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No cop-baiting: Don’t provoke law enforcement to create chaotic or unrealistic situations.</li>
                    <li>Realistic injuries: If injured, roleplay the effects and engage EMS in the scene realistically.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9. New Life Rule (NLR)</h3>
                <p>*After death, your character must forget everything leading to their demise.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forget previous events: You cannot seek revenge or return to the scene after dying.</li>
                    <li>Return restrictions: Wait at least 15 minutes before returning to the area and avoid rejoining the same scene.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>10. Value Your Life (VLR)</h3>
                <p>*Your character’s life must be valued in dangerous situations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fear RP: Show fear when appropriate, such as when threatened with a weapon.</li>
                    <li>Avoid recklessness: Don’t engage in suicidally reckless behavior unless it’s justified by your character’s development.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
