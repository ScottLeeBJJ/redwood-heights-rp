                    <li>Immersion: Avoid references to real-world events or breaking character in-game unless absolutely necessary.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. No Random Deathmatch (RDM)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Give others a chance: Allow players to respond to your actions instead of forcing outcomes (e.g., instead of “I knock you out,” say “I attempt to knock you out, what do you do?”).</li>
                    <li>Avoid unrealistic actions: Don’t perform actions that your character wouldn’t be able to do based on their abilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. No Exploiting or Hacking</h3>

                </ul>

                <h3>9. New Life Rule (NLR)</h3>
                <p>*After death, your character must forget everything leading to their demise.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forget previous events: You cannot seek revenge or return to the scene after dying.</li>
                    <li>Return restrictions: Wait at least 15 minutes before returning to the area and avoid rejoining the same scene.</li>

                    <li>Avoid recklessness: Don’t engage in suicidally reckless behavior unless it’s justified by your character’s development.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <div class="rule-title">
                2. Roleplay at All Times (In-Character Behavior) <span class="arrow">▶</span>
            </div>
            <div class="rule-content">
                <h3>11. Realistic Character Development</h3>
                <p>*All characters must have believable, realistic backstories that justify their behavior, skills, and resources. Avoid creating characters with unrealistic capabilities or behaviors that break immersion.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Character skills: Your character should have limitations, based on their profession, education, and experiences. Don’t play a street thug who also happens to be a master hacker without backstory justification.</li>
                    <li>Consistent RP: Stick to your character’s story and don’t shift their personality or behavior drastically without proper narrative buildup.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>12. No Griefing or Trolling</h3>
                <p>*Intentionally ruining another player’s experience for personal amusement, without any roleplay justification, is not allowed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No camping Pillbox: Do not linger around Pillbox Medical Center with the intention of repeatedly targeting or harassing players coming out of the hospital.</li>
                    <li>No trolling: Avoid acting in an obviously unrealistic manner just to disrupt others’ roleplay (e.g., wearing ridiculous outfits in serious situations, running into scenes making random noises).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>13. Follow Server Economy Rules</h3>
                <p>*Any manipulation of the server’s economy, including exploiting jobs, trades, or currency systems, is prohibited.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No exploiting job systems: Abusing job mechanics to generate excessive money is forbidden.</li>
                    <li>Fair trading: Avoid exploiting trade systems, such as duping items or money, to gain an unfair advantage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>14. Use Appropriate Names</h3>
                <p>*All characters must have realistic and lore-friendly names.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No joke names: Avoid using names that break immersion (e.g., John Cena, Harry Potter).</li>
                    <li>No offensive names: Character names that are offensive, racist, or suggestive in any way will result in a name change request or further action.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>15. Proper Use of Vehicles & Weapons</h3>
                <p>*Vehicles and weapons should be used within reason, following the roleplay context and your character’s background.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No military-grade weapons: Civilians should not have access to military-grade weaponry or high-end vehicles without proper roleplay buildup and authorization.</li>
                    <li>No unrealistic vehicle behavior: Driving vehicles unrealistically, such as off cliffs or through dense traffic at top speeds with no consequences, is prohibited.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>16. Do Not Combat Log</h3>
                <p>*Logging out to avoid consequences such as arrests, death, or any other roleplay scenario is strictly forbidden.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stick with RP: Always finish the roleplay scenario even if it’s not in your favor. Quitting mid-scene is unfair to other players involved.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>17. Age Requirement</h3>
                <p>*The server may have an age restriction to ensure maturity and quality roleplay. All players must be at least 18.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mature behavior: Regardless of age, everyone must act responsibly and handle conflicts or disputes in a mature manner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>18. Respect Staff Decisions</h3>
                <p>*The server staff work to maintain balance and fairness. All players are expected to follow staff instructions and decisions without resistance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No arguing with staff: If you have an issue with a staff decision, follow the proper appeal process instead of arguing during active scenarios.</li>
                    <li>Staff RP participation: Staff may participate in roleplay scenarios, but their authority within the server is final, regardless of their character.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="rule-content">
                <h3>19. No Unrealistic Economy/Wealth Roleplay</h3>
                <p>*Your character’s wealth should reflect their in-game activities and backstory. Avoid portraying extreme wealth or resources unless it’s consistent with your character’s role and development.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wealth buildup: Your character should not own multiple expensive properties, high-end cars, or luxury items without a realistic in-game explanation.</li>
                    <li>Legitimate gains: All large purchases, such as luxury cars or homes, should have a roleplayed backstory justifying how your character obtained them.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>20. No Unrealistic Crime Roleplay</h3>
                <p>*Criminal activities should be realistic and follow logical progression, especially for new characters.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No super-criminals: Avoid roleplaying as a character who can perform every type of crime (e.g., a skilled hacker, street thug, and arms dealer simultaneously).</li>
                    <li>Progression of crimes: Start small (e.g., petty theft) and work your way up to larger crimes (e.g., bank robberies) through proper roleplay interactions and development.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>21. No Forced Roleplay Without Consent (Non-Consensual RP)</h3>
                <p>*Players should never be forced into roleplay scenarios that make them uncomfortable or that involve serious actions like torture, kidnapping, or permanent harm without prior consent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear boundaries: Always communicate OOC with the player if you plan to involve them in a scene with sensitive themes.</li>
                    <li>OOC opt-out: If a player feels uncomfortable with a roleplay scenario, they have the right to opt out OOC, and the situation should be rewritten or avoided entirely.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>22. Gang and Group Roleplay Rules</h3>
                <p>*Groups and gangs are welcome in Redwood Heights, but they must follow specific guidelines to ensure fair and enjoyable roleplay for everyone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gang registration: All gangs must be registered with the server staff, and their actions must align with their registered backstory and goals.</li>
                    <li>Realistic gang behavior: Gangs should avoid unnecessary violence and aim for realistic power struggles, territory control, and interactions with law enforcement.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>23. Hostage Situations</h3>
                <p>*Hostage scenarios can create exciting roleplay but must be executed within specific boundaries.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hostage roleplay guidelines: Hostages must be treated fairly and realistically. Don’t kill hostages without a valid roleplay reason, and give law enforcement time to negotiate.</li>
                    <li>Law enforcement interaction: Allow law enforcement to engage in negotiation tactics. Shooting at cops without any build-up or warning will result in disciplinary action.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>24. Handling Long-Term Injuries</h3>
                <p>*Long-term or permanent injuries should be roleplayed realistically and taken seriously.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical roleplay: If your character is injured in a major event (e.g., a gunshot wound), you should roleplay the recovery process realistically. This may include downtime, limited mobility, or seeking medical assistance.</li>
                    <li>Permanent damage: In cases of extreme injuries (e.g., losing a limb or eye), make sure your character’s future roleplay reflects these limitations consistently.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>25. Respect Public Spaces</h3>
                <p>*Redwood Heights has a variety of public spaces, and players should treat these locations with respect, following in-character decorum.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public roleplay: When in public places, such as restaurants, parks, or shops, ensure your roleplay fits the setting and tone.</li>
                    <li>No unrealistic actions in public: Avoid large-scale violent acts or chaos in public areas without build-up, as it disrupts others’ roleplay.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>26. Staff Assistance and Tickets</h3>
                <p>*If you encounter issues with other players or experience server-related problems, you can contact staff through the server’s ticket system.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ticket etiquette: Be respectful and provide all necessary details when submitting a ticket to the staff team.</li>
                    <li>Staff authority: Staff decisions are final, and players are expected to follow instructions without argument.</li>
                </ul>            
            </div>

            <div class="rule-content">               
                <h3>27. Respectful Use of Communication</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>In-character voice: Keep voice chat consistent with your character’s tone and personality. Avoid OOC topics.</li>

                    <li>No spamming: Spamming voice or text chat breaks immersion.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: During a hostage situation, refrain from irrelevant comments that disrupt the roleplay flow.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professionalism and authority: Behave as a trained officer would. Use appropriate language and follow procedures.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: In a robbery, approach cautiously, communicate with your team, and try to de-escalate before using force.</li>
                    <li>Use of force: Only use force when absolutely necessary. Deadly force should be a last resort.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: After a shootout, if suspects surrender, restrain them instead of continuing violence.</li>
                    <li>Roleplay consequences: Arrests and investigations should have meaningful consequences for both law enforcement and criminals.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: Process suspects properly after an arrest by reading their rights, collecting evidence, and ensuring realistic consequences.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>29. Group Size Limits for Roleplay Scenes</h3>
                <p>*Roleplay scenes should have balanced group sizes to avoid chaos and ensure fairness.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Max group size for hostile scenes: In confrontational scenes like robberies or gang conflicts, groups should not exceed 6 members unless approved by staff.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: Keep participant numbers balanced during a bank robbery to prevent overwhelming the situation.</li>
                    <li>Coordination in large scenes: Manage multiple groups carefully in large-scale roleplays to avoid overwhelming law enforcement or other players.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: In a street brawl, limit the number of participants to maintain balance.</li>
                    <li>Staff intervention: For large events, like gang wars or heists, notify staff in advance to ensure the event runs smoothly.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>No clipping: Don’t place vehicles or objects to glitch through walls or barriers.</li>
                    <li>Realistic prop placement: Props like barricades or cones should be used logically, not for trolling or blocking paths unnecessarily.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>31. No Unrealistic Escaping or Evasion</h3>
                <p>*Evasion of law enforcement must be realistic, avoiding superhuman feats.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No “superhuman” escapes: Don’t perform unrealistic actions like jumping off buildings without consequences.</li>
                    <li>Lawful arrests: If caught by law enforcement, roleplay the arrest realistically rather than constantly trying to escape.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>32. Handling Corruption Roleplay</h3>
                <p>*Corruption roleplay involving authority figures (e.g., law enforcement) can enhance roleplay, but must be handled carefully.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corruption limits: Major abuses of power need staff approval to ensure fairness.</li>
                    <li>Consequences of corruption: Corrupt actions should lead to realistic consequences like investigations or demotions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>34. Handling In-Game Businesses</h3>
                <p>*Businesses must follow realistic guidelines and fit into roleplay.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Business registration: All businesses must be registered with the staff, including a detailed backstory and operational strategy.</li>
                    <li>No business exploitation: Avoid using businesses for unrealistic financial gain without proper roleplay development.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>35. No Griefing at Server Events</h3>
                <p>*Disrupting server-wide events is prohibited.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respect event organizers: Follow event rules and don’t disrupt them for personal gain.</li>
                    <li>Follow event guidelines: Ensure your roleplay aligns with the event’s guidelines to maintain immersion.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>37. Avoiding Conflict Escalation</h3>
                <p>*Conflicts should aim to create narrative-driven roleplay rather than defaulting to violence.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conflict resolution: Try resolving conflicts verbally before resorting to violence.</li>
                    <li>Respect cooldowns: After a conflict, avoid immediately reigniting it. Let it develop organically over time.</li>
                </ul>
